Okay back to the skill graph, i want to iron out a few things here. Firstly, I want to improve its current readability. The first improvement to accomplish that is to ensure that when connected graphs are created, the connections/links are generated in a way that minimizes the total number of link overlaps. For example, imagine you have 3 nodes, singly linked. Left to right node 1 is connected to node 2 and node 3 is connected to node 2 but the [2, 3] link overlaps the [1, 2] link instead of just being a line. Does that make sense? I want to stop that from happening because it looks unclean and the user has to like tidy up the graphs manually to be able to see the graphs. I don't really want to mess with the charges because that kind of screwed things up last time and doesn't really work for very large interconnected graphs.

essentially i want the graph to be maximally sprawled out and cover the largest area that it can. It's a maximizing the area within the graph links problem

I don't want to mess with the physics of the links and dragging. I just wanted the graph to build with minimal overlaps. For example the leaf nodes always point maximally outwards creating a maximally sized web of nodes.
